            Currently, the model in use is distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english, a lightweight and efficient transformer fine-tuned for sentiment analysis. While it offers a good balance between speed and accuracy, for improved performance and more nuanced emotion detection, consider using larger and more advanced models such as:

            cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-emotion-multilabel-latest â€“ ideal for multi-label emotion classification, especially on social media data.

            Other larger models like bert-base-uncased, roberta-base, or xlm-roberta-large can also provide higher accuracy at the cost of increased computational resources.
